## Understanding JWT

### Decoding JWT using JWT.io Debugger

Paste a JWT token into the JWT.io debugger to decode it:

1. **Header:** Contains metadata about the token, such as the algorithm used for signing.

2. **Payload:** Contains user-specific data like `sub` (user ID), `email`, `iat` (issued at), `exp` (expiration time), `aud` (audience), `iss` (issuer).

3. **Signature:** is generated by encoding the header and payload using a secret key that resides on the server. This signature ensures that the token has not been tampered with.

### Validating the JWT

JWT tokens are **not encrypted**, instead they are **signed**. How's how it works:

1. **Public Data:**

   - The **header** and **payload** of the token are **Base64 encoded** but not encrypted. This means anyone can decode and view the information by simply pasting the token into a tool like JWT.io
   - **Note:** Never store sensitive information such as passwords or credit cards details in the payload.

2. **Signature Validation:**

   - The **signature** ensures the integrity of the token. If any part of the token is altered (such as modifying the `exp` or `email`), the signature will no longer match the server's signature.
   - This mismatch makes the token **invalid**, and the server will reject it.

3. **Expiration Time (`exp`):**

   - The token has a limited **time to live** (TTL). After the time has expired, the token becomes invalid, and the user must log in again.

### Key Points

1. **Public vs. Private Data:**

   - JWT tokens are **public** (payload can be decoded). The key to security is the **signature**, which ensures the token hasn't been modified.

2. **Short Expiration Times:**

   - Tokens should have short expiration times to minimize security risks (e.g., 3600 seconds = 1 hour).
   - Once a token expires, the user needs to log in again to receive a new token.

3. **Refresh Tokens:**

   - To avoid users having to log in frequently, refresh tokens can be implemented. Refresh tokens allow the user to request a new access token without logging in again.
