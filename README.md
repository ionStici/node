# Backend

_This repository contains my notes on:_

- [**Node.js**](./mds/node/node.md) : Core concepts.
- [**NestJS**](./mds/nest/nest.md) : Framework insights for scalable server-side apps, documented during my learning process.
- [**TypeORM**](./mds/typeorm/typeorm.md) : ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript to manage database interactions.

These notes serve as a learning log and resource for backend technologies.
